== Installation ==

*NOTE:* We really hope that you find our plugin useful and that it helps you to manage the use of images and relevant accreditation on your website, however, as this plugin makes a number of changes to the structure of the Media Library and other aspects of the base Wordpress code we would recommend that you install in on a test site before going live.

This is only so that you can make sure that the plugin does not have an adverse effect on the custom code which you may have added to the site or any other plugins which you currently use, and vice versa.

We also recommend that you do not test this plugin at the same time as making any other changes to your site. This is because otherwise it is easy to become confused about where a problem is emanating from. Although with smaller plugins and changes you can normally batch test, when a plugin makes such big changes to certain aspects of your sites functionality, solo testing is highly recommended.
